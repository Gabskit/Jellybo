# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a hybrid mobile application built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and packaged into a native mobile app using Apache Cordova. The core web content is located in the `www` directory.

## Current Plan

The immediate goal is to set up the necessary configuration for Cordova to build the application into an Android APK.

### Steps:

1.  **Create `config.xml`:** Create the main Cordova configuration file.
2.  **Create `index.html`:** Create the main entry point for the application.
3.  **Create `main.js`:** Create the main JavaScript file for the application.
4.  **Create `style.css`:** Create the main stylesheet for the application.
